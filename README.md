# RegressionPythonMatrix
Regression Using Python Matrix. 
I run regression using python matrix since this is faster than running regression in STATA.

I use STATA to generate data and runregression.
Run regression using Python in a matrix form. Then, I compare the speed and results from the python to those from STATA.

I found that when I run fixed effect regression with 10K observations, I spent around 30 seconds on STATA while around 5 seconds on python.
