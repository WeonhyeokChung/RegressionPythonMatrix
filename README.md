# RegressionPythonMatrix
Regression Using Python Matrix. 
I run regression using python matrix as this method is faster than regression in STATA.

I use STATA to generate data and runregression. Then, I run regression using Python in a matrix form. Then, I compare the speed and results from the python to those from STATA.

I found that when I import dta file and run fixed effect regression with 10K number of observations, I spent around 1 minute on STATA while 20 seconds on python. Evnironment of my computer is the following:

- MacBook Pro Retina (version 10.14.6 macOS Mojave) 

- with 2.4 GHz Intel Core i5 of processor 

- 8 GB 1600 MHz DDR3 of memory 

- Intel Iris 1536 MB of Graphics.
